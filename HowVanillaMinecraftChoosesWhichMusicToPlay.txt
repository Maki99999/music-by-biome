  Minecraft checks the following in order to determine which song to play next:
  1. if currentScreen is WinScreen -> play Musics.CREDITS
  2. if player is null (not in game) -> play Musics.MENU
  3. if player is in the end and gui.getBossOverlay().shouldPlayMusic() -> play Musics.END_BOSS
  4. if player is in the end -> play Musics.END
  5. if player is under water OR the player's biome has the tag PLAYS_UNDERWATER_MUSIC -> play Musics.UNDER_WATER
  6. if player is not in the nether && player has creative mode abilities
     (player.getAbilities().instabuild and player.getAbilities().mayfly) -> play Musics.CREATIVE
  7. if getBackgroundMusic of the player's biome returns one or more songs -> play one of them
  8. play Musics.GAME
