  - ignore conditions with lower priority than any fulfilled conditions
  - combine music tracks of the fulfilled conditions (same highest priority)
  - randomly choose a track, don't play the same song twice

- New Tab: "Combined":
  - add a button or new UI element for users to add custom combined conditions
  - user can choose a set of conditions from all non-custom conditions
  - all sub conditions have to be active at the same time for the custom condition to be true

  - sort groups: Custom > Minecraft (BGM) > Minecraft (Music Disc) > Mod 1 (BGM) > Mod 1 (Music Disc) > Mod 2 (BGM) > ...
