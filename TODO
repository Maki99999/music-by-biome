- BUG: Pausing and resuming a few times -> gain isn't correct/fade doesn't work correctly (is cut off etc.)
- improve recentMusicTracks by only adding a music track if it isn't already at the top of the list
- maybe a BUG: when saving, what happens to deleted CombinedConditions? also are they still in the config file afterwards?

- in the config screen: a indicator on each condition that tells you if the condition has songs
  - small dot or a vertical bar on the far right
  - also on the tabs?
  - normally white, but when the condition is met, color it green
  - maybe sort it so that the conditions with the indicator are displayed first

- adjust volume of each individual track
  -> edit button that makes a volume slide appear underneath

- a way to invert a condition in a CombinedCondition
  - fix default config: *Not* in nether && this.player.getAbilities().instabuild and .mayfly -> CREATIVE

- settings screen:
  - "reset settings" button
  - "restore defaults" button
  - inputs to adjust fade in/out time
  - maybe: inputs to adjust time between songs

- special compatibility with popular mods:
