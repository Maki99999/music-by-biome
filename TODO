- Real "Preview Music Track" system
- Custom Music: dont show files with unsupported file endings, hide file ending in nice string
- after closing the config menu (onAfterConfigSave), reevaluate which songs to play, resume song if possible, else start a new one
- fix: some tags are there multiple times
- Fade in/out
- music group collapse
- search boxes
- New Tab: "Combined":
  - add a button or new UI element for users to add custom combined conditions
  - user can choose a set of conditions from all non-custom conditions
  - all sub conditions have to be active at the same time for the custom condition to be true
- in condition list show the last 5 visited biomes/relevant biome tags (configurable)
- tab "all" with all conditions?
- Scrolling in right column should reset after selecting something in the right column and after selecting another tab
- Scrolling in left column should reset after selecting another tab
