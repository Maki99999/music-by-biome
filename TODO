  - improve checkmark (pressed down beacon button)
  - minecraft music doesn't work in built jar (javax.sound.sampled.UnsupportedAudioFileException -> missing dependency again?)

- Improvements:
  - make menu music work
    - stop music when level turns null (when going into main menu)
  - after closing the config menu (onAfterConfigSave), reevaluate which songs to play

- New Tab: "Combined":
  - add a button or new UI element for users to add custom combined conditions
  - user can choose a set of conditions from all non-custom conditions
  - all sub conditions have to be active at the same time for the custom condition to be true

- Improve condition list readability:
  - in condition list show the last 5 visited biomes/relevant biome tags (configurable)

- Improve music list readability:
  - sort groups: Custom > Minecraft (BGM) > Minecraft (Music Disc) > Mod 1 (BGM) > Mod 1 (Music Disc) > Mod 2 (BGM) > ...
